What is the Tools Feature
===============
The tool package and report module allow a user to specify a tool, required files, tool options, sample, and sample options to run in Cuckoobox. The tool is run on the sample within cuckoobox and then any files the tool creates are returned to the host machine along with any output the tool may have given.
